### Comment
`#` -       Single Line Comment

### String Declaration

`''`      -   Single Line String

`''' '''` -   Multiline String type 1

`""" """` -   Multiline String type 2

----
**_Important Note_**: Some resources mentioned that `"""` or `'''` are the ways to declare multiline comments but they are not.
As per [official Python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#strings), they are types for declaring multiline string.
Hence, one should never use it for declaring multiline comments. And might be feature needed in Python, I believe.

### Type command
On Python Interactive terminal, spell out `type` command and it'll give you result for input.

```py
# For integer
>>> type(1)
<class 'int'>

# For float
>>> type(1.0)
<class 'float'>

# For string
>>> type('One')
<class 'str'>

```
It also identifies result of operations

```py
>>> 1.0/2.0
0.5
>>> 1.0//2.0
0

# Float as first output value is 0.5
>>> type(1.0/2.0)
<class 'float'>

# Integer as second output value is 0
>>> type(1.0//2.0)
<class 'int'>
```
