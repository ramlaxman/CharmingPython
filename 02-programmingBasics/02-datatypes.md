## Data Structures in Python

### List
1. Its a linear data structure.
2. With index number of elements in List, we can insert or delete elements.
3. Indexing starts with 0 from left to right and -1 from right to left.
4. 
numbers = [1, "3", 4.5]
print(type(listVar))

### Dictionary
1. Its a linear data structure.
2. With index number of elements in List, we can insert or delete elements.
3. Indexing starts with 0 from left to right and -1 from right to left.

dictVar = {"name":"rahul", "age":5}
print(type(dictVar))

### Sets
setVar = {1,2,3}
print(type(setVar))

### Tuple
1. Its a linear data structure.
2. With index number of elements in List, we can retrieve or delete elements.
3. It is ordered collection from left to right in sequences.
4. Tuples are classified as immutable sequences. Direct change operations cannot be applied to tuples.
5. Tuples are heterogeneous like Lists. It can store different data types.
6. Tuples can't be modified. In case of modification, you need to create copy and change elements.

tupleVar = (1, 2, 3)
print(type(tupleVar))
