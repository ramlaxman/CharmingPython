### Comment
`#` -       Single Line Comment

### String Declaration

`''`      -   Single Line String

`''' '''` -   Multiline String type 1

`""" """` -   Multiline String type 2

----
**_Important Note_**: Some resources mentioned that `"""` or `'''` are the ways to declare multiline comments but they are not.

As per [official Python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#strings), they are types for declaring multiline string.

Hence, one should never use it for declaring multiline comments. And might be feature needed in Python, I believe.
