## Primitive data types

Primitive data types are already existed or predefined data types in language library.

These data types are not container type. It means they can't store other input inside it.

Following are primitive data types in Python:

- Int
- Float
- Complex

**Integer:** 

Any number without decimal or fraction is integer. Python can store the max integer length
as much as computer memory i.e. RAM can handle.

**Float:** 

Any number with decimal, positive or negative is float.

**Complex:** 

Any number which follows pattern: 
(Number)(operator)(Number)j

For example, 
- 4+5j
- -4+6.4j

These numbers are complex numbers.
