## Which version?
  * *With end of life and support to Python 2, Python 3 is ready for general availability and recommended version to use.*
  * #### Always use latest version from [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

   
## Installing Python in your machine
   ### Windows
   * Download [Python 3.x.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)
   * Don't forget to check option of 'Add Python to Environment Variables'.
   * Run and install.

   ### Linux
   * Install using appropriate package manager (e.g. yum or apt depeding on your system)
   * For Fedora/Redhat/Centos,  `$ yum install python3`
   * For Ubuntu/Debian, `$ apt-get install python3`

   ### Mac
   * `brew install python3`

## Install using the source code
   * Recommended for advanced users to dowonload [latest Python source code](https://www.python.org/downloads/source/)
   * Helps you to contribute to python project.
   * Out of scope both for beginners and learning the Python programming

## Verify installation
   * Go to Command Prompt or Terminal and type ```python```.
   * You will see this prompt:  `>>>`

## It's good to have an IDE
   * I recommend [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/sha/download?build=stable&os=win32-x64-user) due to following reason:
      
       * Lots of extensions available
       * Directly integration with GitHub and other distributed version control system tools
       * One time pain of learning shortcuts as most of the python libraries work in VScode.
       * You can run python interpreter and python files in same environment.
